# E-Commerce-Recommendation
As we have all seen that commercial websites show related products through the lens of “customers who viewed also viewed” or “customers who purchased also purchased”.
The objective of the case study is to identify related products that we can detect and show how we would detect them automatically for a e-commercial business.
This case study presents a recommendation model using Jaccard similarity.
